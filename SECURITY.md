# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately, through GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting on this repository (Security → Report a vulnerability) or by contacting the
maintainer, [@Ashin-06](https://github.com/Ashin-06), directly. Do not open a public issue.

Include what you found, how to reproduce it and what an attacker could do with it. You should
get an acknowledgement within 5 working days. Please give us 90 days to fix an issue before
disclosing it, and don't test against anyone else's deployment.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| 1.0.x | yes |
| < 1.0 | no (prototype releases) |

## Scope

In scope: the API, the commitment scheme, range proofs, OR-proofs, Fiat-Shamir transcripts, the
Merkle-sum solvency tree, the stored verifications and audits, the container image and the CI
configuration. A proof that verifies for a false statement, or a way to learn a committed value
from a bundle, is the most serious class of report.

**The cryptography in this repository is hand-written and has not been reviewed by a
cryptographer.** Production mode refuses to start without an explicit acknowledgement of that.

Out of scope: the simulated FIP and the development-only prover, and findings that need an
already-compromised host or a leaked API key with the matching role.

This project has **not** had an independent security review or penetration test.
